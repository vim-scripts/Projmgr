*Projmgr.txt* Plugin for loading/unloading/switching Vim sessions

This plugin provides a more easy to use interface for the Vim session
feature.

I wrote it first only for my own needs. I have a bunch of small
projects lying around on my hard disk. I would like to load a whole
project, play around with it, switch to another if I like, or simply
unload it.

This plugin provide a menu system for 'Load', 'Unload' 'Switch to' a
project(session). None-menu-driven version is not available at the
moment. 

Install:
1. Copy the projmgr.vim into your plugin directory or
   $HOME/.vim/plugin.
2. Copy the perl script to somewhere. E.g plugin/perl.
3. Copy this documentation into the corresponding doc directory.
4. Make a directory: $HOME/.vim/projects
5. Modify the script and change "/.vim/plugin/perl/buffers.pl" to
   where you put the perl script. (I know I know, I will try to figure
   out a way to do these automatically. You are more than welcomed to
   tell me if you know how.)

Usage:
Once it is installed, a menu 'Projects' will appear in your Vim
window. Load all your project file, define your view, folding etc. (Or
you can load a session file altogether.) And use the 'Projects->Save
to Project' to save a session. The file will be save at
$HOME/.vim/projects/. (You can copy your vim session file directly
into that directory if you want.) After that, 'Projects->Load-> will
load that project. Obviously enough, 'Unload' will unload all buffers
for that project and you can switch between projects.

Known bug:
1. If the number of files in the projects directory goes down for some reason,
   the 'refresh' menu won't remove the obsolute items.
