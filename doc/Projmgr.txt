*Projmgr.txt* Plugin for loading/unloading/switching Vim sessions

This plugin provides a more easy to use interface for the Vim session
feature.

I wrote it first only for my own needs. I have a bunch of small
projects lying around on my hard disk. I would like to load a whole
project, play around with it, switch to another if I like, or simply
unload it.

This plugin provide a menu system for 'Load', 'Unload' 'Switch to' a
project(session), etc. None-menu-driven version is not available at the
moment. 

Install:
1. Automatic: 
   Simply use the install.sh script and following the instruction. 
   Requires:
   bash, Perl.
2. Manual:
   You don't need to do this ideally. But if for whatever reason the 
   install shell script is not working for you, try to following these
   steps:
   a) Copy the projmgr.vim into your plugin directory or
      $HOME/.vim/plugin.
   b) Copy the Perl script to somewhere. E.g plugin/perl.
   c) Copy this documentation into the corresponding doc directory.
   d) Make a directory: $HOME/.vim/projects. This where the vim session
      files will be stored.
   e) Modify the script and change the s:projmgr_dir to the plugin
      directory where you installed projmgr.vim.
   f) Copy all (if you have any) your session files into the directory
      mentioned in d).

Usage:
Once it is installed, a menu 'Projects' will appear in your Vim
window. Load all your project file, define your view, folding etc. (Or
you can load a session file altogether.) And use the 'Projects->Save
to Project' to save a session. The file will be save at
$HOME/.vim/projects/. (You can copy your vim session file directly
into that directory if you want.) After that, 'Projects->Load-> will
load that project. Obviously enough, 'Unload' will unload all buffers
for that project and you can switch between projects.

Known bug:
1. Vim will not be notified when you unload the current session so that
   when you use 'Projects->Current Project', vim will still be reporting
   the latest one you loaded.
2. Unload/switch are not working on Windows :(.
3. Sometime if I try to load/unload a project several times, not all the
   file in the session will be loaded by Vim. But all this script does 
   is call :so <session_file> so I am wondering if it is a Vim bug.
