This plugin provides a more easy to use interface for the Vim session
feature.

I wrote it first only for my own needs. I have a bunch of small
projects lying around on my hard disk. I would like to load a whole
project, play around with it, switch to another if I like, or simply
unload it.

This plugin provide a menu system for 'Load', 'Unload' 'Switch to' a
project(session). None-menu-driven version is not available at the
moment.

This version is for Linux only. I am still struggling to get a Win32 version done.
